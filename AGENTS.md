# Agent and contributor rules

Start at [README.md](README.md). Grok Bot runtime behaviour lives in [plsi.md](plsi.md), [persona.md](persona.md) and `skills/`; `skills/shared/team` assigns every skill to one bot of the roster (PLSI, the core team and the opt-in specialists).

- **Layering:** `plsi.life` never imports `plsi.map` or `plsi.policy`; `plsi.policy` never imports `plsi.life` and sees the world only through `plsi.map` (care context via `plsi.map.mapper.context`).
- **One vocabulary:** every enum lives in `src/plsi/vocab.py`; nothing inline elsewhere. One name per concept, State Map terms kept (State Map, registry, selector, mapper, storyline, correspondence types, claim ladder).
- **Models live with their layer:** shared types in `src/plsi/models.py`; layer models in `life/`, `map/`, `policy/` `models.py`; the event envelope in `events.py` (each layer registers its own payloads). `contracts/*.schema.json` come only from `plsi contracts export` (`schemas.py`); never hand-edit them.
- **Agents judge, code computes:** Python holds calculators, connectors, the log, gates and the scorer; judgment (choosing, interpreting, predicting) lives in skills. Code may record a bot's judgment and may only make it stricter.
- **No grab-bag modules:** no `util`/`helpers`/`common`; name a module after the one thing it does.
- **No hard-coded interventions or medications** in code, maps, skills, persona or fixtures. Fixtures use placeholders such as `test-drug-a`. Evidence is collected at run time.
- **No pointer READMEs, shims, backups or legacy mirrors.** The only README is the root one.
- **Base URLs** come from `mothership/references/` (one file per kind); keys only from env / `.env` via `plsi.keys`; the one exception is the Mothership relay's install token, minted at enrollment and kept in `<instance>/mothership/install.json` (masked with `keys.hide`). Never print secret values.
- **HTTP** only through `plsi.net` (called as module attributes so tests can fake it).
- **Soft limit 300 lines per module.** Prefer the smallest correct implementation.
- **UTF-8:** every `open()`/`read_text()`/`write_text()` passes `encoding="utf-8"`; no BOMs; LF line endings.
- **Extend by tiers:** a user map, then a formula (`engine: expr`), then a code extension (`plsi ext install`). Extensions add operations and never replace core gates, deid, scoring or the event log. They are full-trust code: install one only with the user's explicit approval naming its source.
- **Never edit `events.jsonl`.** Corrections go through `plsi retract`; gates are never bypassed.
- **Tests** run offline: `python -m pytest -q` from the repo root. `tests/` is gitignored except the tracked MH contract tests and their fixtures; mark network tests `live` and biolearn tests `clocks`.
