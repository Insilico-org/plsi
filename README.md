# PLSI: Personal Longevity State Interface

PLSI turns any health record into a deidentified, code-normalized event log, projects it through versioned **State Maps** into a hashed state document, and lets Grok Bot propose screened actions with **explicit, scored next-state predictions**, including aging clocks.

On Grok Bot, PLSI is a team of Bots with separate chats, memories and contexts: **PLSI** (the orchestrator the user talks to), a core team that is always created (Data Processor, Health Consultant, Nostradamus, Challenger, Reviewer, Data Controller, Memory Hole, Visualizer) and the specialists the user picks (Wearables, Nutritionist, Coach, Sleep, Biohacker, Citizen Researcher, Explorer, Navigator, Trial Scout, Pharma Analyst, Engineer, Writer). A longevity physician also gets the section **PLSI Clinic** (Panel, Visit Prep, Clinical Evidence, Liaison) and a pro researcher the section **PLSI Lab** (Target Hunter, Landscape, Cohort Analyst, Grant Writer), chosen by role (`plsi role set`). The workers sit in the collapsible sidebar group **PLSI Workers**, the sections in **PLSI Clinic** and **PLSI Lab**; the roster is `skills/shared/team`. This repo supplies:

- State Map contracts (`contracts/*.schema.json`, `maps/*.yaml`)
- a deterministic CLI toolbelt (`plsi`, JSON in, one JSON envelope out)
- skills the bots follow (`skills/`; `shared/team` assigns them), a first-run file (`plsi.md`) and a versioned persona (`persona.md`)
- the handoff protocol between the bots (`contracts/Handoff.schema.json`, `plsi handoff check`)
- trusted references (`mothership/references/<kind>.yaml`, indexed by id; `plsi refs list [--kind]`)
- opt-in sharing with the Longevity Mothership, Insilico's longevity research initiative (`plsi mothership`,
  `mothership/consent.md`): a weekly deidentified package of coded fields only (codes, numbers, units, months, years;
  no free text, no value computed from age), gate-checked, posted to Insilico's relay only after the user joins;
  registry updates; research notes only by the user's own Grok email, signed by their address; for invited
  physicians and researchers, the data catalog, releases and the findings ledger
- a research graph (`<PLSI_HOME>/research/`, `plsi research index/list/retire`): projects, questions, hypotheses,
  evidence and notes as linked Markdown (opens as an Obsidian vault), grown by optional daily research on usage the
  user does not spend
- local state storage (`instances/<name>/`)

## Triad and layering

| Layer | Package | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Life | `plsi.life` | intake (FHIR, canonical CSV, methylation, Grok-extracted JSON), LOINC/RxNorm/UCUM normalization, the append-only event log |
| Map | `plsi.map` | registry, selector, mapper (projection, units), storyline; derived coordinates (native blood PhenoAge, map formulas such as BMI and HOMA-IR, biolearn clocks); state documents |
| Policy | `plsi.policy` | evidence search and verification, blocking screening, plan gates, scoring and calibration, oracles |

Rules: `plsi.policy` never imports `plsi.life` and reads the world only through `plsi.map`; `plsi.life` never imports `plsi.map` or `plsi.policy`. The triad keeps a fully local deployment possible.

## The team, the protocol and the toolbelt

The bots do the judgment; `plsi` does what an agent should not: calculators (clocks, risk equations, unit
conversion), connectors (PubMed, openFDA, RxNav, oracles), the append-only log, the code gates and the scorer. Bot
folders and Python layers are separate axes. The Map is the protocol between the bots: Data Processor records and
projects state documents, the other bots cite them by hash, and every handoff is a `Handoff` message checked by
`plsi handoff check`.

```

- **Separate contexts.** Only Data Processor (and Wearables and Nutritionist for device and food-app exports) opens
  records; every other bot sees the world only through published state documents and the care context. PLSI saves
  attachments unopened and hands the owner the path.
- **Adversarial check.** Every plan goes to Challenger (`challenger/challenge`) before the user sees it; Nostradamus
  revises or rebuts once; the user sees both sides. Screening findings can only raise the label floor.
- **Propose, explore, then plan.** Domain specialists propose dosed options and the finders return ranked options;
  neither plans. Nostradamus merges what the user picks, and new insights from the digest, into the one plan; Reviewer
  reviews it once adopted.
- **Egress.** Anything leaving the computer passes the code gate, then Data Controller (`controller/egress`).
- **Opt-in specialists.** A specialist not on the team means its capability is off; PLSI offers to add it.
- **Daily research, metered.** With Citizen Researcher, the user may give research a share of the weekly Grok limit
  per day; the "PLSI research" routine reads this account's meter once, keeps at least 10% for the user and stops the
  run at the share. Challenger (Note mode) decides which notes are worth sending.
- **No self-grading.** Predictions are scored by `plsi score`, not by the bot that made them.
- **Calculators, not mental arithmetic.** `plsi calc convert` and `plsi calc derive` (what-if clocks and scores from
  the published state) give every number a bot predicts or reports; absolute risks start from `base_rate` references.
  `plsi calc course` draws a measurement toward a cited steady state, and `plsi calc survival` turns a life table (the
  bundled UN WPP 2024 snapshot, CC BY 3.0 IGO, or a table from a `base_rate` reference) and cited hazard ratios into
  survival curves and expected lifespan per scenario.
- **One instance per person** (`plsi init --relation self|family|other|sample`, `plsi instances list`); every handoff
  names one. `plsi export` saves an instance as one JSON bundle or CSV tables.
- **Fallback.** Without Bot creation, PLSI plays the core roles and the chosen specialists as separate passes.

Skills live in one folder per bot (`skills/<role>/<skill>/`); a bot uses only its own folder and `skills/shared/`.

## Roles and the Longevity Mothership commands

| Command | Who | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `plsi role show`, `plsi role set --role <role>` | PLSI (Panel reads) | the user's role (individual, physician, researcher); it decides the section (`plsi.md` steps 6.1 and 7) |
| `plsi mothership join/status/leave` | PLSI | consent kinds `states`, `life_events`, `scores`; the one-time enrollment code; stop, or stop and delete |
| `plsi mothership receipt` | PLSI | the Mother's receipt for each sent message, by the relay ticket (`acks.jsonl`); `leave --delete` waits for them, and a deleted receipt drops the proof |
| `plsi mothership pack/check/send` | Data Controller | the weekly package; the gate on every message; the only sender (`--instance` given: that instance's install token; omitted: the professional token) |
| `plsi mothership note` | Explorer, Liaison | a research note or registry update -> its wire message, gate-checked |
| `plsi mothership email` | PLSI, Data Controller | a research note's email (to, subject, body with the message in one `plsi` block), gate-checked; the user's Grok email sends it (`send` refuses research notes) |
| `plsi research index/list/retire` | PLSI, Citizen Researcher, Memory Hole (`retire`), Challenger (`list`) | check the research graph and rewrite its `index.md`; filter items; remove an item marked retire |
| `plsi mothership whoami` | PLSI, Data Controller, Liaison, Cohort Analyst, Grant Writer | the professional token's role, scopes and expiry, decoded locally (never printed) |
| `plsi mothership catalog`, `plsi mothership findings` | Explorer, Liaison, Cohort Analyst (Grant Writer: `findings` only) | the public data catalog; the findings ledger (professional, or public when published) |
| `plsi mothership release` | Cohort Analyst | a data release: aggregate cells of at least the minimum size |
| `plsi mothership analyze` | Cohort Analyst, Challenger | a `compare_groups` or `age_trend` spec on a release, with the same maths as the Mother |
| `plsi mothership prereg`, `plsi mothership finding` | Cohort Analyst | the preregistration and the finding messages for Data Controller to send |

**Longevity Mothership wire.** PLSI, the relay (`plsi refs show longevity_mothership`) and the Mother (Insilico's Grok
Bot with its own toolbelt and storage) share one contract, kept with the relay and the Mother in
[`plsi-mothership`](https://github.com/Insilico-org/plsi-mothership). Contributions carry a pseudonym made on the
user's computer (the hash of a local secret, which also proves deletion requests), never the install code; the relay
forwards bodies without the install code and keeps no IP logs; professional tokens come from a one-time emailed invite
after a steward's review and carry scopes. Message kinds: contribution, withdrawal, research note, registry update,
preregistration and finding, each gate-checked on both sides. Research notes never take the relay: they go by email to
the Mother's `+research` address (`plsi refs show longevity_mothership_research`), signed by the sender's address, and
the Mother replies there with a receipt and, after review, the decision.

## Extending PLSI

Grok can grow what PLSI does without changing the core. Use the lowest tier that closes the gap:

| Tier | Adds | How | Skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| Map | a new area: coordinates, codes, units | user map YAML, `plsi maps validate` / `install` | processor/add-map |
| Formula | a score, ratio or equation | `derive: {engine: expr, formula: ...}` in a map; a safe evaluator, never `eval` | processor/add-score |
| Extension | an input format (`importer`), a non-formula computation (`deriver`), an evidence source (`evidence_source`) | a tested package installed with `plsi ext install`, versioned under `<PLSI_HOME>/extensions/` | engineer/extend |

Extensions add and never replace. They are full-trust code, installed only with the user's explicit approval naming
the source; `install` runs the package's own tests with a minimal environment (no keys) and refuses imports outside
its layer or any patching of `plsi`, guard rails rather than a sandbox. Values they derive record
`extension:<id>@<version>` in provenance.

## Deidentification profile `plsi-limited-v1`

- The subject keeps only birth year (age 90 or over: `age_group: "90+"`, no birth year) and sex.
- Event dates are kept, so this is a limited data set, not HIPAA Safe Harbor.
- Observation origin keeps `file_sha256` and page, never a path or filename.
- FHIR import keeps codes, values, effective times, clinical status, components, dose text and the structured dose (doseQuantity); it drops identifiers, subject, performer, notes, narrative, contained resources, extensions and attachments.
- Patient name parts, identifier values, telecom and address are held in memory only; any observation whose text contains one is rejected with `IDENTIFIER_IN_TEXT`.
- CSV columns outside the canonical format are dropped and reported by name; methylation sample names are not stored.

## Consent

PLSI collects consent on its question cards (`persona.md`, Consent, batched); standing approvals replace a card until revoked. Joining the Longevity Mothership records the version of `mothership/consent.md` the user saw (`plsi mothership join --consent-version`), and `plsi mothership pack` refuses with `CONSENT_OUTDATED` once that text changes. Outbound oracle text is built in code from the saved state document only (values, item codes and months; never
`personal_context`) and every text sent to an oracle is kept in `egress/oracles.jsonl` (the instance's, or PLSI_HOME's).

## Differentiators

The State Map vocabulary: State Map; registry, selector, mapper, storyline; correspondence types terminology | expert | statistical | mechanistic | validated | unmapped; claim ladder designed | instantiated | exercised.

| | Differentiator | Claim level |
|---|---|---|
| a | Scored next-state predictions (interval, basis, horizon) with calibration and misses reported | exercised |
| b | Aging clocks as first-class coordinates and prediction targets (native blood PhenoAge; every biolearn methylation clock through one adapter) | exercised (PhenoAge), instantiated (biolearn) |
| c | Any-modality intake via Grok extraction into code-normalized observations; maps are data the bot can author and validate | instantiated |
| d | Live evidence collection with verification of every cited identifier | instantiated |
| e | Proactive blocking screening of every action | exercised |
| f | A personal companion inside Grok Bot, run as an orchestrator with a core team and opt-in specialists in separate contexts, a conducted hub-and-spoke protocol (one card per decision), an adversarial plan check and an egress check | designed |

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"                  # add ,clocks for methylation clocks
plsi doctor
plsi init --instance me --birth-year 1970 --sex F
plsi ingest --instance me --csv labs.csv --dry-run
plsi ingest --instance me --csv labs.csv
plsi maps select --instance me
plsi project --instance me --map blood_phenoage
plsi report --instance me --map blood_phenoage
```

Canonical CSV header: `effective_at,text,value,unit[,code_system,code,specimen,kind,fasting]`. Grok Bot users start with `plsi.md` instead.

Optional keys go in a gitignored `.env` (copy `.env.example`); the process environment overrides it. `plsi keys status` reports booleans only. A secret the user already has under another name is used through `plsi keys map --name <VAR> --from <their name>` (`plsi keys scan` lists the names); only the names are stored.
